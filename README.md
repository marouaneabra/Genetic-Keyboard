## Running the Program

Clone the Genetic-Keyboard repository

```
git clone https://github.com/totorotoby/Genetic-Keyboard.git
```

### Compiling

Compile the program using our Makefile

```
make genMain
```

### Running the tests

We provided test files in the current directory

```
./genMain <filename>
```
If you would like to run your own tests, follow the following steps to get the files ready to be used

```
chmod +x editfile.sh
```
run the editfile shell script on the test file

```
./editfile.sh <testfile>
```

then run the genMain program with the following command

```
./genMain <testfile.filtered>
```
